## Introduction

For this project we looked to find a correlation between education and economic status in Ireland, on a county-by-county level and individual level.

We first aggregated 4 open datasets, and they were as follows:

Level of education per county - [link](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/er-by-highest-level-of-education-completed-county-and-city-censusyear-sex-and-age-at-which-full-time)<br/>
Average age of ending full-time education - [link](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/ceased-of-population-aged-15-years-and-over-2011-to-2016-by-county-and-city-censusyear-and-statistic)<br/>
Secondary schools in Ireland - [link](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/second-level-schools-and-pupils-by-year-county-type-of-school-and-statistic)<br/>
Earning data per county - [link](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/nea08-mean-and-median-annual-earnings-by-county-sex-year-and-statistic)<br/>

Using these datasets, we created a full-scale knowledge graph covering our domain.
